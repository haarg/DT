DT
==

    DT is a very simple and thin wrapper over DateTime::Moonpig, which in
    turn is a wrapper over DateTime. DateTime::Moonpig brings immutability
    and saner operator overloading at the cost of cartoonish name but also
    lacks date/time parsing capabilities that are badly needed all the
    time.

    There is a myriad of helpful modules on CPAN but all that typing!

INSTALLATION

    To install this module type the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test && make install

DEPENDENCIES

    DateTime::Moonpig is the parent class for DT. DateTime::Format::ISO8601
    is required for parsing ISO8601 date/time formats.

    PostgreSQL related methods are optional and depend on
    DateTime::Format::Pg being installed.
